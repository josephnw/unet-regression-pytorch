This repository contains simplified codes for "Deep Learning for Estimating Lung Capacity on Chest Radiographs to Predict Survival in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", which was submitted to Radiology. The purpose is to estimate lung volume using single frontal chest radiographs.

Paper
===============
* Deep Learning for Estimating Lung Capacity on Chest Radiographs to Predict Survival in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (submitted to Radiology)

Implementation
===============
A PyTorch implementation of TiSepX Lung Volumetry.
We implemented this code based on [Unet](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet/tree/master/unet) code.
(*Thanks for U-net.)
